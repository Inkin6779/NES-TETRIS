# Functional Tetris

The original NES Tetris written in a style that adheres 
to haskell's paradigms as much as possible.

Featuring clear separation of data and program logic, 
all-out immutability, some Monads and a platform independent
thread-safe core logic. All bundled with a simple ScalaJS GUI
for playing in the browser. 

I wrote this as an exercise to get more used to functional 
programming with the cats framework in particular and
with the whole style in general. 

### Usage

Just download the html and compiled JS files from one of the 
release folders and open with your browser. There are no ads
and I do not collect any data. In fact, you can just play offline.

### Building yourself

Clone the project and treat as a usual ScalaJS project:

    cd path/to/FunctionalTetris
    sbt "~fastOptJS" # recompiles on every source change
    sbt fullOptJS    # for a compressed release version
    
### Can I include this in my webpage?

Sure. Just include one of the JS files found inside the 
release folders inside of a `<script>` tag. Then you 
can use the JS 'API':

    FTetris.startGame(
        canv: html.Canvas,
        onpointchange: Int => Void,
        onlevelchange: Int => Void,
        onlineclear: Int => Void,
        ongameend: () => Void,
        onpausestart: [OPT] () => Void,
        onpauseend: [OPT] () => Void
    ); 
    
Where `canv` is a reference to the canvas you want the game 
to render in, e.g. `document.getElementByID('myCanvas')`.
The game fits itself into the canvas dimensions, but it 
assumes that the equation `height = 2 * width` holds, for
aesthetic reasons.

The others are callbacks that either take an `int` - the
updated value - or no arguments and they all return nothing.
The pause callbacks are optional since the canvas has
a built-in pause effect.
